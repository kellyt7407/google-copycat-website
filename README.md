I choose to do the Pupilpath login for this project because I was't familiar with html and css. I decided to do something simple, so I can be more use to typing these code. Pupilpath login page seems to have a fun background, which caught my eye. I thought it would be fun to try to create the same background. While making this project, I had a lot of help from my friends and classmates. I learned that I had to code separating for separate parts in order to make sure when hovered, it doesn't underline everything. The most difficult part for me was to placement for each word since it gets really frustrating when it gets unsymmetrical because it's a few pixels off. I"ve became used to using html and css after this project and I can challenge myself with a more difficult project in the future.
